What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?        

    After initializing a repository, a hidden directory called .git will be
created. This .git direcory will contain metadata for commit histories relating
to files in this repository. Doing this will change an ordinary directory into
a repository that can save different versions for each commit. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area is the intermediate place where you put the changes you want to 
commit at once together. It is in between of the working directory and the  
repository sinces files are modified in the working directory, then they are 
collected and organized in the staging area and at last, the changes are stored 
in repository. The value it offers is a way to group many changes into one  
commit to make each commit reflect one logical change.
